Please read this End User Licence Agreement carefully before putting the software product into use and before implementation of 
the installation: This End User Licence Agreement is an agreement between you in representation of the legal entity  - hereinafter 
referred to as “User” - and your contractual partner from the DMG MORI -Group as designated in the order confirmation - hereinafter 
referred to as “Supplier” – and governs the usage of the software purchased within the supply contract (“Supply Contract”) in rela-
tion to the delivered tooling machine thereunder, provided that the software is not part of a seperate licence agreement between you 
and the Supplier resp. an affiliated company of Supplier, for example DMG MORI Sofware Solutions GmbH. 

The software will be disposed for your usage pursuant to the subsequent § 1, under the condition that you consent to all provisions 
of this End User Licence Agreement. By installation, copying, download or any other usage of the software you declare your consent 
with the provisions of this End User Licence Agreement. 


Article 1
Object of Purchase and Licensing

1.	The object of this agreement shall be the permanent transfer (Überlassung) of the MDC computer program in binary code 
	including any associated user documentation ("Licensed Software") and the granting of the rights of use specified in Articles 
	2-4. The hardware and software environment within which the Licensed Software is to be used, shall be stipulated in the us-
	er documentation. The Licence Software enables the User to get access to machine state information via MQTT, OPC UA 
	and/or MTConnect. The details are described in the user documentation. 

2.	The usage of the Licensed Software in accordance with these terms is included in the purchase price of the Supply Contract. 
	As far as the Licensed Software is left for usage on basis of a singular agreement, the partical agreed price therein applies. 

3.	The Licensed Software is part of the hardware supplied with the tooling machine or the product and is activated for the ex-
	clusive usage on the tooling machine or the delivered hardware purchased by virtue of the Supply Contract.  

4.	The characteristics and functionality of the Licensed Software shall be as stated in the user documentation. Any information 
	contained therein shall be regarded as specifications of performance and not guarantees (Garantien). A guarantee (Gar-
	antie) shall only be granted where expressly designated as such.

5.	Installation and configuration services shall not fall within the scope of this agreement, but within the scope of the Supply 
	Contract. 

6.	The creation and usage of the Licensed Software was based resp. is carried out under partly utilization of open source soft-
	ware (“Open Source Software”) on the basis of licensed agreements applicable to such Open Source Software between 
	Supplier and the licensor (the “Open Source Terms”). Supplier does not charge any license fee to User for its use of such 
	Open Source Software. The Open Source Terms are part of the provided documentation as enclosure to this End User Li-
	cense Agreement and available for perusal therein. The usage of Open Source Software under this End User Licence 
	Agreement is granted on the basis of the deposited Open Source Terms which are in no case limited by this End User Li-
	cense Agreement to the disadvantage of User. The particular used libraries and programs and the applicable Open Source 
	Terms are

7.	The User hereby accepts the Open Source Terms and acknowledges to the extent required, by the relevant Open Source 
	Terms, that Supplier excludes any warranties, indemnities and liabilities in respect of User’s use of the Open Source Soft-
	ware. Upon request of User and where required by the Open Source Terms, Supplier shall provide to User or make available 
	a copy of the source code of the Open Source Software. To the extent there is a conflict between this End User Licence 
	Agreement and the Open Source Terms, the terms of the Open Source Terms shall prevail over this End User License 
	Agreement with regard to the Open Source Software only.

8.	The usage of the Licensed product is additionally carried out under utilization of the software PDFNet Custom SDK on the 
	basis of a license agreement between PDFTron Systems Inc. as licensor and Supplier as licensee. Pursuant to such license 
	agreement the usage of the software PDFNet Custom SDK exclusively for CELOS is unrestrictedly permitted, provided, how-
	ever that, the User refrains from in particular, but not limited to, compiling, de-compiling,  re-engineering, modifying, copy-
	ing or to creating any derivative works of PDFNet Custom SDK. The User hereby declares its consent with such require-
	ments

9.	The terms and conditions of this End User Licence Agreement shall also apply to enhancements of the Licensed Software 
	installed after delivery of the tooling machine („Updates“), even if by installation of Updates the applicability of the terms 
	and conditions of this End User Licence Agreement has not been reconfirmed. In case that upon installation of Updates fur-
	ther Open Source Software, the usage of which is permitted to Supplier by the licensor by virtue of application of separate 
	and related Open Source Terms, the provisions in preceding numbers 6 and 7 in this Article 1 shall apply accordingly.


Article 2
Reproduction Rights and Access Protection

1.	The user shall be entitled to copy the software supplied insofar as such copies are required to use the Licensed Software in 
	accordance with its intended purpose, including error correction. 

2.	In addition, the user may also make a copy for backup purposes. Only one single backup copy may be made and retained 
	however. The user shall visibly mark the backup copy created with the wording "Backup Copy" and a copyright notice in fa-
	vour of Supplier.


3.	The user shall be obliged to take appropriate measures to prevent unauthorised access to the Licensed Software and li-
	cense code, as well as the user documentation, by third parties. 


Article 3 
Decompiling and Program Modifications

1.	A reverse translation of the program code provided into other code forms (decompiling) and other ways of re-engineering the 
	various production stages of the Licensed Software (reverse engineering), including program modification, shall be exclu-
	sively permitted with regard to the Open Source Terms mentioned in Article 1 No. 6 above.

2.	Copyright notices, serial numbers and other features used to identify the program may not be removed or modified under 
	any circumstances. The same shall apply to suppressing the display of such features on the screen.


Article 4
Resale and Sub-Licensing

1.	The User shall be entitled to permanently or temporarily transfer (überlassen) the Licensed Software to a third party provided 
	that the third party declares its agreement with the continued validity of the present contractual terms and conditions and 
	agrees that they shall henceforth also apply to it. The former User's right to use the Licensed Software shall lapse as a result 
	of the transfer.

2.	The User shall not be entitled to transfer the Licensed Software to third parties where there are reasonable grounds for 
	suspecting that the third party will breach the contractual terms and conditions, in particular in respect of making unauthor-
	ised copies. 


Article 5
Claims for Defects

1.	Supplier hereby warrants (gewährleistet) that the software shall be of the agreed quality and that the user may use the Li-
	censed Software without breaching third party rights. 

2.	The user shall be required to check the Licensed Software for apparent defects immediately following receipt and to notify 
	Supplier of the existence of any such defects immediately. Failure to do so shall result in such defects being excluded from 
	warranty. The same shall apply where any such defects become apparent at a later time. Section 377 of the German Com-
	mercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) shall apply.

3.	In the event of a material defect, Supplier shall first be entitled to supplementary performance (Nacherfüllung), in other words 
	to rectify the defect ("rectification") (Nachbesserung) or offer a replacement at its own discretion (Ersatzlieferung). For re-
	placement, the user shall accept a new version of the Licensed Software, where applicable, except where this would result in 
	unreasonable adverse effects. In the case of defects in title, Supplier shall, at its own discretion, either provide the user with 
	a lawful means of using the Licensed Software or shall modify the latter such that it no longer infringes any third party rights. 

4.	Supplier shall be entitled to undertake warranty-related services at the user's premises. Supplier shall also be deemed to 
	have satisfied its rectification obligation by providing updates to download on its homepage equipped with an automatic in-
	stallation routine and offering the user telephone support or remote support to resolve any installation problems which may 
	occur. 

5.	The User's right to a reduction in the purchase price or to withdraw from the agreement in the event of two failed rectification 
	or replacement attempts shall remain unaffected. No right to withdraw shall arise in the case of minor defects. Where the us-
	er claims compensation for damages or reimbursement for any costs, Supplier shall be liable in accordance with Article 6.

6.	With the exception of claims for damages, warranty claims on the grounds of material defects shall lapse within one year. 
	Where Supplier is liable for damages pursuant to Article 6, the statutory limitation period shall apply. The limitation period 
	shall commence upon the date of commissioning of the tooling machine by User.

7.	Where there is a software maintenance agreement between Supplier or a third party and User, the rectification period for 
	defects shall be in accordance with the periods stipulated within such maintenance agreement.


Article 6
Liability

1.	Supplier shall be liable without limitation 

	-	in the event of wilful intent or gross negligence (bei Vorsatz oder grober Fahrlässigkeit),
	-	for injury to life, limb or health (für die Verletzung von Leben, Leib oder Gesundheit), 
	-	in accordance with the stipulations of the Product Liability Act (nach den Vorschriften des Produkthaftungsgesetzes) and
	-	within the scope of any guarantee (Garantie) accepted by Supplier.

2.	In the event of any slight negligent breach (leichte Fahrlässigkeit) of an obligation that is fundamental to fulfilment of the 
	contractual purpose (material obligation), Supplier liability shall be limited to the amount of damages foreseeable and typical 
	based on the nature of the business in question.

3.	Any further liability on the part of Supplier shall be excluded.

4.	The present limitation of liability shall also apply to the personal liability of Supplier employees, representatives and official 
	bodies.

5.	Supplier shall only be liable for the loss of data up to the amount that would have been incurred up to the point of restoration 
	in the event of the data being properly and regularly backed up.


Article 7 
Other Provisions

1.	The User shall only be entitled to offset undisputed or legally established claims.

2.	Amendments and additions to this agreement must be made in writing. This also applies to any modification or waiver of this 
	clause. Electronic documents in text form shall not fulfil this written form requirement.

3.	The User's general terms and conditions of business shall not apply.

4.	The Licensed Software may be subject to re-export/export restrictions, e.g. imposed by the United States of America or the 
	European Union. The User shall be required to comply with these regulations in the event of any resale or other export.

5.	German law shall apply to this End User Licence Agreement to the exclusion of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 
	for the International Sale of Goods dated 11.04.1980 (CISG).

6.	The place of fulfilment shall be the place of the registered seat of User. The sole place of jurisdiction shall be Munich provid-
	ed that each party is a merchant or legal entity under public law or does not have any general place of jurisdiction within 
	Germany.

7.	In the event of the invalidity of individual provisions of this End User Licence Agreement, this shall not affect the validity of 
	the remaining clauses. The contracting parties shall endeavour to find an effective clause in place of the invalid one which 
	most closely reflects the economic meaning and purpose of the invalid provision.

8.	The Open Source Terms referred to in Article 1 No. 6 of this End User Licence Agreement shall be binding and integral 
	components of this agreement.

9.	English words and expressions followed by a German term in brackets shall bear the legal meaning as described to the 
	German term in brackets under German Civil Law. The German translation has been included for the avoidance of doubt in 
	this End User License Agreement as it is governed by German Law, but drafted in English language.
