## Introduction

With this data source you can connect electrical signals to your IoTconnector lite device. The signals can either be digital (Sink or Source, 0V/24V) or analog inputs (0-10V or 0-20mA). This is especially useful if you want to connect older equipment without a digital control or a machine where access to the control is not possible.

## Default Configuration

By default the Data Source is configured the following way:

- DI0 - Emergency Stop
- DI1 - Stack Light: Red
- DI2 - Stack Light: Yellow
- DI3 - Stack Light: Green
- DI4 - Stack Light: Blue
- DI5 - Machine Available

- AI0 - Current Sensor
- AI1 - Not used
